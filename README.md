# Pizza Recipe Page

Hello! This project is all about creating a recipe page using basic HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

1. HTML Boilerplate: I started by setting up the HTML structure of the webpage using a boilerplate.

2. Directory and File Organization: I created directories and files to keep my project organized. This helped me stay on track and easily locate specific components as I worked on them.

3. Terminal Navigation: I navigated through the terminal to access and manage my project files. This allowed me to efficiently work with my code and make necessary modifications.

4. Content Creation: I added headers, paragraphs, images, and links to bring the recipe page to life. By carefully structuring and styling the content, I was able to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

5. CSS Styling: I leveraged CSS to enhance the appearance of the recipe page. By applying styles such as font size, colors, margins, and padding, I was able to create a visually consistent and aesthetically pleasing layout.
