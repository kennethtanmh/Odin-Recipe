                <p id="description">My pizza is topped with four different kinds of cheese. Besides mozzarella, the three remaining types of cheese are a matter of personal preference. However, Parmigiano-Reggiano, provolone, and Fontina cheese are most commonly used. Alternatively, quattro formaggi may also include tomatoes, especially in northern Italy where they also like to add Gorgonzola to the topping.</p>

            <ol>
                <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">Instructions:</p>
                <li>Add the flour and the dry baker's yeast to a large bowl — mix them together so they brewer's yeast is evenly dispersed in the flour</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, dissolve the malt in warm water, add it to the bowl with the flour, together with olive oil and salt</li>
                <li>Knead by hand until you get a smooth dough</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, then cover it with cling film and store it in a warm spot for 3-4 hours, or until tripled in volume</li>
                <li>Once risen, divide the dough in half, shape each half in a ball, roll them out into discs on a floured surface, then place each in a non-stick tray and let them rise for another hour</li>
                <li>Once an hour has passed, sprinkle the pizza base with the four cheeses and black pepper</li>
                <li>Bake in a 250°C/480°F oven, with the grill option turned on, for 15 minutes, until the pizza's edges are golden and its bottom dry.</li>
                <li>Once baked, serve immediately.</li>
