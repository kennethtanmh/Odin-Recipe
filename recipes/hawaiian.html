                <p id="description">My pizza dough recipe yields about 2 pounds of dough, which is enough for two 12-inch pizzas. Toppings listed below are enough for one 12-inch pineapple & ham pizza. Freeze the rest of the pizza dough for another time, or make two pizzas by doubling the topping ingredients. Feel free to use 1 lb. store-bought pizza dough instead of homemade.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; font-size: 30px;">Ingredients:</p>
                <li>1/2 recipe homemade pizza dough</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon (15ml) olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon (8g) cornmeal</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (127g) pizza sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
                <li>1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (75g) cooked ham or Canadian bacon, sliced or chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (82g) pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)</li>
                <li>3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 30px;">Instructions:</p>
                <li>Dough: Prepare pizza dough through step 3. If using store-bought frozen pizza dough, make sure it’s thawed.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15–20 minutes as you shape the pizza in the next step. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well. Lightly grease a large baking sheet or pizza pan with 1/2 Tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.</li>
                <li>Shape the dough: When the homemade dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half and freeze half the dough for another time—see freezing instructions in the pizza dough recipe. </li>
                <li>Top & bake the pizza: Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush remaining olive oil all over the dough. Top the dough evenly with pizza sauce, then add the cheese, ham, pineapple, and bacon.</li>
                <li>Bake for 14–15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Remove from the oven.</li>
                <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Freezing and reheating instructions below.</li>
